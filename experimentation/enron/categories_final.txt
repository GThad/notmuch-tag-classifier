The Berkeley labeled enron database labels each email with multiple labels.
The labeling was done by two individuals, so there are also frequencies next to each
label that tell us whether one or both of them assigned an email that label.
The labeling done has some eccentricities, however. There are labels, sub-labels, and
sub-sub-labels. We need to choose which to keep. For the sake of generality, we will
use all these labels and append names separated by dashes as needed. 
In addition, the labels are numbers and each number is assigned a label descriptions.
We will map here, the numbers to new number as well as concrete labels. Note we
don't care about level 4 labels since they give tone. We care most about 1 and 3 since
they give topics. We are unsure about 2 since they give labels based on data types.
We also note that this test with the Enron database is going to be a bit off of the
actual use case since the database consists of the emails of multiple people
rather than one. In a sense, we need to pretend these emails are for one person.
Perhaps this will test the limits since we are using labels from multiple people for
one person.

Entries in form:
	x -> y, aLabel
which means if number x appears in the .cats file and has frequency 2, then add
aLabel (y) to the label set for the email. What is given below is a subset of the given
categories.
